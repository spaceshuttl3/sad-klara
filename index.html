    <p>A small book for a little girl.</p>
    <p>Hei babii , if you clicked on this section , most probably your energy is not much and my little baby girl is not that happy in this moment.And thats why i am here , i need to be useful in something and not
     just piss you off while you cook no ? hahahah. My pretty baby , my lame baby actually , i don't really know what is the reason why right now you are sad and i can't know it 
      But i know that whatever it is you will make it , you always did ... 
      "So keep going- because the world needs your uniqueness." 
      This is one sentence of the actual book , and i think you need to hear this right now. 
      You are unique in this world , you are so special , something you cant find somewhere else...
      People next to you know that , that's why they try to take you down , cause everything that is so beautiful and unique creates hate and enviousness. 
      The way your eyes shine , the way your lips move while you speak , the hair getting through your hair , everything is perfect about you and whatever you think is imperfect , when you meet the right one , he will not make you feel there are imperfections in you. 
      The way you make everyone's around you happy , the way you bring so much energy into people's life it's something i never exprienced in anyone. 
      I don't know if i am exactly the reason why are you feeling sad , that's why i didnt spend much words about telling how much i do love you. 
      But i do , i do fucking love my baby , and you always been so special to </p>
  </div>
  <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 4)">
    <p>me that i know one day someone will see you the same way i did , and that someone will treat you better tho than i did , and that day is close.
     If the motivation of your sadness is cause you think i don't care about you anymore, it's wrong. 
     I care about you day by day , and when you will think i am not, i want you to hug thightly the peluches i gave you and think that it,s me while you read those words. 
     They gonna sound always the same i know, but there are no other words to express what i feel for you..        
     You are a blessing from god that fell into my life, you always called me an angel , but the real angel that fell from the sky right down into my heart is you.
     I never felt so loved and understood by a person in my life so much , and i wish i could have gave you the same.
     It's true, i have a lot of anger on you for have left me and chose your friends, but i can't never deny all the good things you did to me and all the memories and good sex either.
     Nothing feels the same since the moment you left. Not even my own life. Everything looks so empty and bland , everything looks so grey and dark 
     There are no more colors in my life,  you were my color , a vivid one , a strong one that used to colorate  my life day by day.
     
    
    
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 5)">
    <p> I miss everything about you , a few days ago i just realized i forgot for a moment how beautiful it was to sleep with you, with your cold feet touching my skin and your unexpected moves when you were about to fall asleep.
      I am so scared to forget all those little things about you (maybe its another reason why i think we are reaching an ending..)...for me they were never little. I always noticed everything , and i always liked everything. I miss you baby , i miss my angel , my color, my baby.
      In the next page you will find a few sentences i really liked from a book i read. I hope you like them too and i hope you will get better after reading this.

    <p>I love you, my special girl. Manu.</p>

    <p>if not a sould that crossed mine without asking any permission.</p>
    <p>I allowed you, all that love.</p>
    <p>And before i gave it in your hands,</p>
    <p>I sealed it carefully in a battered heart.</p>
